<h1>Special Considerations for Outsourced Activities</h1>
<p>The designation of activities as routine versus non-routine will continue to dictate the appropriate business authorization and accounting review limits needed for journal entries. Activities designated as routine will not require business authorization.  Activities designated as non-routine will require business authorization and accounting reviews, with the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>The outsourced partner should obtain the Business Transaction Authorizer and appropriate Corporate Accounting review (where required) based on the approval limits, prior to providing entries to GBS FSS.</li>
<li>GBS FSS/HRSS owns ensuring the Accounting Transaction Owner review is obtained as these sign-offs are within GBS FSS/HRSS.  As a part of this process, GBS FSS/HRSS should review the entries for overall reasonability and compliance with policy (e.g., appropriate documentation, appropriate authorization).  GBS FSS/HRSS can reserve the right to reject an entry based on this review.</li>
</ol>
<p>Routine entries that are systemically generated can be posted by the outsource partner.  Routine entries that are manually generated should generally be posted by GBS FSS/HRSS,  except when it is not practical, exceptions should be agreed with the G/L Service Line Manager and Corporate Accounting.  All non-routine entries should be posted by GBS FSS/HRSS.</p>
