<h1>Appropriate Tax authorization should be obtained for non-routine tax adjustments</h1>
<p>Booking of quarterly or annual tax provisions does not fall under these authorization limits.</p>
<p>Examples of tax entries that require approval are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tax reserves (both income and indirect tax reserves)</li>
<li>Changes to a deferred tax balance that is not the result of a quarterly or year-end provision.</li>
<li>Tax entries related to acquisitions or divestitures.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any other entries that are outside the provision process.</p>
