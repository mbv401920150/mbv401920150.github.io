<h1>For business transaction owner</h1>
<p>Further downward delegation should follow the business unit delegation of authority where one exists. Delegation of authority must be consistent with this policy and must include a finance representative at all levels. The Company's DOA must be followed. Legal Entity Owner's delegation is available in the Stewardship Legal Entity oversight toolkit. Where no delegation of authority exists, the above policy applies by default. When posting in Consolidations, the Region Comptroller's Group will coordinate with the Consolidations AD to obtain the signature of the VP of Corporate Accounting.</p>
