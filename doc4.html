<h1>Principles for documentation and Maintenance of documentation</h1>
<p>Should be sufficient enough to allow a person without intimate knowledge of the operations to arrive at the same accounting conclusion as the originator and accounting reviewer.<br/>
<u>Supporting Documentation Maintained by the Service Center</u> - The person who books the entry is responsible for ensuring the appropriate documentation is on file for each journal entry processed.<br/>
<u>Supporting Documentation Maintained outside the Service Center</u>- The entry requestor should provide the accounting transaction processor with sufficient information to perform the accounting review. This may be a one-page summary or email that will be filed by the person posting the entry.  Additional supporting documentation will be filed by entry requestor outside of the Service Center.<br/>
Documentation for Tax (Income) Contingencies:  a journal entry with appropriate authorization is sufficient documentation for Income Tax Contingencies and will be retained by Global Tax.<br/>
For year-end MSA/SRA accruals may be held in the local markets (without an exception), because of the volume of supporting documentation.
