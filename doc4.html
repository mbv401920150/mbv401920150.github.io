<h1>Principles for documentation and Maintenance of documentation</h1>
<p>
The principle surrounding journal entry documentation is that the supporting documentation should be sufficient enough to allow an independent person without intimate knowledge of the operations to arrive at the same accounting conclusion as the originator and accounting reviewers.</br>
Documentation should be relevant and sufficient to justify the validity of the entry and the amount.</br>
The key items that should be addressed in the documentation are:</br>
The underlying reason for the entry including adherence to GAAP where not clear, the basis for the calculation, the proper accounting period for the entry and appropriate authorizations. Any exception to this policy should follow SAFE Stewardship 2.1- Exceptions to Accounting or Reporting Requirements.</br>
All original supporting documentation for the entry should be attached. In certain instances, it is not practical to attach all original supporting documentation to the entry and, therefore, the entry is supported by a SAP data extract or spreadsheet. In such instances, the existing support should clearly indicate the basis of the entry and the rationale for Business Transaction Authorizer’s origination and approval of the entry.</br>
This documentation may be available for the overall accounting organization as opposed to being maintained by each accountant, but it is expected that there is adequate work process documentation for these type of entries that is updated as changes occur and for which controls have been determined and reviewed
For Record Retention limits please see Records Retention website for retention limits.</br>
Documentation for Tax (Income) Contingencies:  a journal entry with appropriate authorization is sufficient documentation for Income Tax Contingencies.  Sufficient documentation will be retained by Global Tax.  See Accrued Liabilities 4.3 - Indirect Tax Contingencies and Tax 1.3 – Accounting for Income Tax Uncertainties.</br>
Unless specifically agreed and documented otherwise in an up-to-date list of exceptions, the supporting documentation should be maintained by the person who posts the entry (i.e. the Service Centers) – even if the entry is originated by another person or group.  Exceptions should be approved by the FSS Global Service Manager, the Service Center Director, and the organization who has agreed to maintain the documentation.  The Service Center should ensure that the organization which will maintain the documentation is aware of their stewardship responsibilities and the applicable retention limits.</br>
Examples where it makes sense to maintain documentation outside of the Service Centers include situations where local statutory requirements dictate that the documentation remains in-country.</br>
Specifically, documentation for year-end MSA/SRA accruals may be held in the local markets (without an exception), because of the volume of supporting documentation
The MSA/SRA budget holders have full accountability for archiving the full supporting documentation in line with local/US tax requirements and to provide the support to auditors as requested.</br>
Therefore, there are two potential scenarios for maintaining supporting documentation.</br></br>

<u>Supporting Documentation Maintained by the Service Center</u> - The person who books the entry is responsible for ensuring the appropriate documentation is on file for each journal entry processed. </br>
<u>Supporting Documentation Maintained outside the Service Center</u> - In those cases where the supporting documentation is maintained by the entry requester, the entry requester should provide the accounting transaction processor with sufficient information to perform the accounting review as noted in section 5 above.  The person who books the entry should ensure that there is documentation from the entry requester with the journal entry details (accounting period, legal entity, accounts, and amounts) and an overview of the business rationale.  This may be a one-page summary or email that will be filed by the person posting the entry.  Additional supporting documentation will be filed by entry requester outside of the Service Center.
