<h1>Special treatment for acquisition and divestiture activities</h1>
<p>Acquisition opening balance sheet entries and opening balance sheet adjustments, purchase price allocations, divestiture entries, and acquisition reserves generally require additional consideration, scrutiny and authorization. Initial, recurring entries for license agreements or transition services agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures are deemed to be non-routine entries for the first 3 months worth of entries, and routine thereafter. In some cases, it may be more appropriate for the specific deal team (through a corporate accounting representative) to coordinate the review and authorization of the specific journal entries.
