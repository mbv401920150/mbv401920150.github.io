<h1>Special treatment for acquisition and divestiture activities</h1>
<p>Acquisition opening balance sheet entries and opening balance sheet adjustments, purchase price allocations, divestiture entries, and acquisition reserves generally require additional consideration, scrutiny and authorization. Initial, recurring entries for license agreements or transition services agreements related to acquisitions and divestitures are deemed to be non-routine entries for the first 3 months worth of entries, and routine thereafter. Some large acquisitions and divestitures involve a large number of unique transactions and journal entries that are worked by specific deal teams/contacts, often times outside the typical Region Comptroller’s Group and/or Corporate Consolidations roles.  In some cases, it may be more appropriate for the specific deal team (through a corporate accounting representative) to coordinate the review and authorization of the specific journal entries; no additional approvals are required from the accounting and business transaction owners as these individuals separately review the closing balance sheet, deal economics, summary of entries, etc. as coordinated by the corporate accounting representative.  Additionally, a periodic summary review with the VP, Corporate Accounting, covering the net impact of the deal, may be a more appropriate review and sign off in line of approval of individual entries. The right for a specific deal team contact to review and approve journal entries should be documented and aligned with the VP, Corporate Accounting.  The decision to utilize summary documentation rather than journal entity approval should also be documented and aligned with the VP, Corporate Accounting.
