<h1>Local GAAP journals</h1>
<p>Local GAAP Journals will follow the intent of US GAAP journals with regard to definition of routine and non-routine journals. The approval authorizers will be the main difference.<br/>
Routine entries should be documented, but no approval will be needed for these entries.   New routine entries will have to be approved the first time they occur only.<br/>
Due to the possible low materiality of many legal entities, the Steward and/or Country Tax Manager can request informally to receive copies of journals of a lower value.<br/>
