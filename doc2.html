<h1>Approval and review process</h1>
<p>The business/entry requester has primary responsibility to ensure that the entry is appropriate in light of the current business environment, the entry or analysis is supported by sufficient documentation, the entry is in compliance with SAFE and local/US GAAP, and the entry is posted to the correct accounts and in the correct period
<u>For all non-routine postings of $100M or greater</u>, the appropriate business authorization and accounting reviews should be obtained prior to posting the journal entry.  The entry requester is responsible for obtaining approval from the Business Transaction Authorizer.  The accounting review should focus on the accounts, timing, and reasonability considering the nature of the entry.  
<u>For all routine postings and for non-routine postings less than $100M</u>, it is not a requirement of this standard to review each posting; however, processes such as reconciliations, should be in place to ensure the integrity of the financial statements.  If the Accounting Processor is concerned about any entry, then he/she should elevate the entry for additional reviews prior to posting.
It is the responsibility of the authorizing individuals, to review the documentation provided with the journal entry to ensure appropriateness.
Business approvals and accounting reviews may be provided by the one-up manager of the approver listed if the person listed is not available.
For non-routine entries, posted in a subledger, the requirement to obtain formal written concurrence for entries posted outside of Consolidations resides with Region Comptroller’s Group.  For non-routine entries requiring posting in SEM, it is the responsibility of Associate Director, Corporate Consolidations, to obtain the formal written approval of the VP, Corporate Accounting, rather than Region Comptroller’s Group,  where required.  Region Comptroller’s Group should send all requests for SEM postings including email approvals to the Associate Director of Corporate Consolidations (copying the Group Manager of Corporate Consolidations), as they will be used as support for the journal posting along with the VP, Corporate Accounting written approval along with support, where required.
